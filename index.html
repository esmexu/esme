    <h1>Esme is soft-spoken, 
        but strong minded</h1>
    </div>

    <div class="item2">
    <p>As a newbie to the world of human computer interaction, Esme strives to use her knowledge in psychology, 
        curiosity about the unknown, and passion for making an impact in people’s lives to do more research 
        in the field of user experience research and human-centered design.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="item3">
    <h2>Who Is Esme</h2>
    <p>Esme studies Psychology and Organizational Studies because she is interested in humans and 
        groups made up with humans. Some other things she loves about life include talking to strangers, 
        playing the guitar, lifting weights, and making up recipes.</p>
 
    <h2>What Keeps Esme Going?</h2>
    <p>“I grew up in China and moved to a small town in Michigan, U.S., when I was 15 years old. 
        That’s when I realized how huge the world really is and how lucky I am to be alive at such an exciting, 
        rapidly-evolving, and fascinatingly-diverse world. To experience the vastness of the world, 
        I grew out of my shyness and became loud and talkative during my college years. Now, my passion is to use 
        technology to connect people who are different and make the big world feel smaller.”</p>
