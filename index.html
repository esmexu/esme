    <h2>What Keeps Esme Going?</h2>
    <p>“I grew up in China and moved to a small town in Michigan, U.S., when I was 15 years old. 
        That’s when I realized how huge the world really is and how lucky I am to be alive at such an exciting, 
        rapidly-evolving, and fascinatingly-diverse world. To experience the vastness of the world, 
        I grew out of my shyness and became loud and talkative during my college years. Now, my passion is to use 
        technology to connect people who are different and make the big world feel smaller.”</p>
