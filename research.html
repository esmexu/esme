    <h3>THE "SHIPT" PROJECT</h3>
    <P>The “Shipt” project is a research project I was involved in from start to 
        finish at the Social Innovations Group at U of M School of Information. 
        We evaluated the feasibility of an online grocery delivery application, 
        “Shipt”, in alleviating the transportation challenges faced by many living 
        in the inner city areas.</P>

    <h3>DOMINANCE/PRESTIGE ORIENTATION IN LEADERS</h3>
    <p>The Coalitions, Hierarchy, Individual Motivated Processes Lab at the U of M 
        Ross School of Business focuses on leadership behaviors, specifically, two 
        distinct types of leaders: the dominance oriented leader, and the prestige 
        oriented leaders. As a research assistant, I helped survey designing and 
        content creating for a online stimulation of leader-follower interaction.</p>
