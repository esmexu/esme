    <h3>TSAA WEBSITE DESIGN</h3>
    <P>In order for the alumni of Thus Spoke Ann Arbor, 
        a Chinese Theater Club on U of M campus to have a online space to 
        commemorate the great work and memories they had during their time 
        in Ann Arbor, I created this website to keep the most precious 
        photographs on file.</P>

    <h3>CCI PROJECT</h3>
    <p>At the Center for Campus Involvement, the leaders of higher education 
        are interested in knowing studentsâ€™ involvement on campus as it relates 
        to their racial, ethnic, and cultural background. After collecting data 
        from the student body, I analyzed and created this infographic. </p>
